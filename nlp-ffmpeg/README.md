# NLP-FFMPEG
A repo where the objective is to compile the training material, the model and eventually a fully functioning program that can take natural language commmands like "transform this video [FILENAME].mp4 into another file of the same name in .avi, using H.264 compression" or "download this video [LINK] and transform it into mp3, and cut it into half"

### Motivation
With the boom of LLMs and such, I thought it could be a nice experiment to show that with smaller more traditional models we can finetune a small BART transformer model into doing simple Sequence2Sequence operations that make life easier without the overcomplexity of Billion parameter models.

It is still in works tho...
